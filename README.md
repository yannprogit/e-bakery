About the project:
E-bakery is an online bakery api open 24 hours a day, every day, where you can order food and have it delivered.

This api responds to the fact that we don't necessarily have a bakery nearby, and so we cannot enjoy the world's different pastries, which is sad, and that is how E-bakery solves this problem.

Getting started:
- Create an empty database named "e-bakery" on phpmyadmin or similar.
- execute the node server.js command
- you can populate the database with the /populate-db route (you will need to be logged in with an admin account to do this).

About the team:
The project was realized by Yann Sady and Nicolas Keerpal.

We had a final developer Swan Breton, but unfortunately he had to leave the project on December 8, 2023, we still thank him for his contribution.
